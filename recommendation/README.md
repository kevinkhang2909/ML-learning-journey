- **Content-based filtering:** This approach analyzes item characteristics and user profiles to provide 
recommendations. It suggests items similar to the ones users have shown interest in, based on shared 
attributes such as genre or keywords.

- **Collaborative filtering:** By identifying patterns among users or items, collaborative filtering 
generates recommendations. It looks for similarities between usersâ€™ preferences or item ratings to 
suggest items that others with similar tastes have enjoyed.

- **Hybrid recommender systems:** These systems combine multiple techniques to enhance recommendation 
accuracy and diversity. They leverage the strengths of different approaches, such as content-based 
and collaborative filtering, to provide more personalized suggestions.

- **Knowledge-based systems:** Using explicit knowledge and rules, knowledge-based systems make 
recommendations based on specific criteria or constraints. They incorporate domain knowledge to 
suggest items that align with predefined rules or user preferences.

- **Popularity-based systems:** These systems rely on the overall popularity of products or items 
within a particular demographic. Recommendations are based on what is trending or frequently 
purchased by others.
